====================================
Telemetry sample configuration files
====================================

All the files in this section can be found in the ``/etc/ceilometer/``
directory.

ceilometer.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration for the Telemetry services and agents is found in the
``ceilometer.conf`` file.

This file must be modified after installation.

.. literalinclude:: ../samples/ceilometer.conf
   :language: ini

event_definitions.yaml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``event_definitions.yaml`` file defines how events received from
other OpenStack components should be translated to Telemetry events.

This file provides a standard set of events and corresponding traits
that may be of interest. This file can be modified to add and drop
traits that operators may find useful.

.. remote-code-block:: ini

   https://opendev.org/openstack/ceilometer/raw/tag/mitaka-eol/etc/ceilometer/event_definitions.yaml

pipeline.yaml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pipelines describe a coupling between sources of samples and the
corresponding sinks for transformation and publication of the data. They
are defined in the ``pipeline.yaml`` file.

This file can be modified to adjust polling intervals and the samples
generated by the Telemetry module.

.. remote-code-block:: ini

   https://opendev.org/openstack/ceilometer/raw/tag/mitaka-eol/etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml

event_pipeline.yaml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Event pipelines describe a coupling between notification event_types
and the corresponding sinks for publication of the event data. They are
defined in the ``event_pipeline.yaml`` file.

This file can be modified to adjust which notifications to capture and
where to publish the events.

.. remote-code-block:: ini

   https://opendev.org/openstack/ceilometer/raw/tag/mitaka-eol/etc/ceilometer/event_pipeline.yaml

policy.json
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``policy.json`` file defines additional access controls that apply
to the Telemetry service.

.. remote-code-block:: json

   https://opendev.org/openstack/ceilometer/raw/tag/mitaka-eol/etc/ceilometer/policy.json
